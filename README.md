# Create React App `npm test` with Puppeteer

In this repository I am trying to recreate what I expect is the end result of
https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer/tree/master/examples/create-react-app
from scratch, because the linked example doesn't seem to have a tutorial associated
with it.

I am recreating this without running the linked example or going through its Git
history as this way it is going to be more fun and feel less like work for me.

Steps as I _think_ they go, of course I don't know if they actually do yet.

1. `npm install --save-dev puppeteer @types/puppeteer`

- [ ] TODO: Follow https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer

I also requested a tutorial is provided so that if I do manage to reserve
engineer the example I can compare it with the tutorial and see how wrong I got
it.
