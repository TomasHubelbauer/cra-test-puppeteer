# Create React App `npm test` with Puppeteer

This repository was originally about recreating this repository with no steps:
https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer

However, I have since found this repository which also lacks how-to steps:
https://github.com/xfumihiro/jest-puppeteer-example

I linked a few resources below in To-Do which should help with landing on a CRA
setup with Puppeteer tests.

## To-Do

### Try to figure this out using these resources

### Look into replicating with PlayWright as well
